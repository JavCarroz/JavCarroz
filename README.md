I'm Jav, a Web Developer.

I work primarily **Frontend** but love to build and get my hands on **Backend** code as well.

I also do small/random artsy code snippets as personal projects (Godot, Pico-8).

I'm currently working primarily with **React, Redux + Toolkit, Typescript, Tailwind, Next.js and Firebase**. My **AI philosophy** is using it to _learn what I don't know_, otherwise _building rapidly what I already have mastered_.

I'm working on activating my repo history with personal projects since _a lot of my professional work the last 8+ years is under NDAs_. (Probably around +70 projects by now).
